<img class="about-img" src="Images/portal.jpeg.jpg"<p>If I start with telling you all about me, we could be here all day. So instead, I thought I would start telling you how I learned Web Design.</p>
 <p>At the beginning of 2025, I decided I wanted to pursue the idea of publishing a book that I wanted to write called <span class="reference">“Dizzy Dimension”.</span> So, I started the process of enrolling in school and was recommended to take the course that had a fancy title <br>
    <span class="reference">“e-business Development Engineering”</span> , but after a few months I just started using the simple name which be <span class="title">“Web Design”.</span> What I didnt realize at first is that taking the course would be teaching me more then one new language. From  <span class="reference"> XML to HTML </span>and lots more…</p>
<p>The best part about starting the process of coding the website is when things start coming to life and its a lot more complex than you would think.</p>
<p>One thing I would like to explain is that there are a couple different ways to design a website. You can use frameworks like “square space” or “Wix” and with those you can just pick items from list that would look good together and the framework with just do the background work. Or you could use Programs like <span class="reference">“VS Code” or “WebStorm” </span> and you can do all the coding from behind the scenes putting everything into place step-by-step until everything comes together and thats what formed the whole website your currently reading…</p>

<p> As much as I am the creator of the website and the upcoming book(s), there are others that have helped me during this process.
To name a few:
<ul>
<li>
<span class="reference team-name1"><p>Darien Baker-</span> She came up with a whole world and gave me permission to tap into that world and use it to enhance my story line. Thank-you so much for your help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""> <span class="reference team-name2">Chris Snow-</span> Chris was essential to the team from helping  with character creation. To motivation along the way, Thank-you  for help!</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="reference team-name3"> <p> Else </span>To be honest there are many others that having been helping me along the way. So instead of mentioning everyone separately I would like to say thank-you  to <span class="reference team-name3">ALL</span> my supports along the way. I have only been able to continue this adventure because of all of you!</p>
